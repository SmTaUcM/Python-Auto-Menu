# Python Auto Menu
A Python module that automatically creates a console-based menu system which features key detection.

- **Description:** Sick of creating the same old terminal based menu system over and over again for back-end Python projects I designed this Python module as a script that can dynamically create a menu given a set of options. The module will create a slick console-based menu which detects arrow key presses to animate your menu selection on screen. Pressing enter will then trigger whatever function you pass as an argument for the given menu selection.

- **What I Learned:** In this project I further enhanced my python skills by enhancing my module creation skills. I learned how to detect and interpret keyboard key strokes and connect them to code functionality within Python.
